# TJ Spross Blog


Project was forked and redone from an original Jekyll theme found [here](https://github.com/Jack614/jalpc_jekyll_theme)

#### Fork, then clone

**Fork** the repo, and then **clone** it so you've got the code locally.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/<your githubname>/tjspross.github.io.git
$ cd tjspross.github.io
$ gem install jekyll # If you don't have jekyll installed
$ rm -rf _site && jekyll server
```
